Question A

Your goal for this question is to write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether they overlap. As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8).

Ans:- Answer is included in main.py file in which logic as follows
      the x-axis line will overlap any of the value for both line
      parameter is less then the previous axis parameter.
      I don't include test case because it is not stated in question
